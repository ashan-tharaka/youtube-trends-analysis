The YouTube Trend Analysis Project is a data engineering and data analysis project designed to analyze trending YouTube videos. The goal is to extract insights from trending video data, such as:

Most Popular Categories: Identify which video categories (e.g., music, gaming, news) are most frequently trending.

Engagement Metrics: Analyze the relationship between views, likes, dislikes, and comments.

Trending Video Titles: Visualize common words in trending video titles using a word cloud.

Channel Performance: Determine which channels have the most trending videos.
